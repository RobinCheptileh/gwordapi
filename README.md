# Gword

## Synopsis

Gword is a web app that generates all possible combinations of letters that make up an english word when provided by a set of letters and a limit. It is written in Go and utilizes Websockets.

Find it on [Heroku](http://gwordapi.herokuapp.com/)

## Example

When you input a set of letters say `robin` with a limit of `3`, the results would be:
```
1. ROB
2. ORB
3. NOR
4. OBI
5. RIB
6. BIO
7. BON
8. ION
9. BIN
10. NIB
```

## Motivation

You guessed it, *4 Pics 1 Word* ofcourse! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
